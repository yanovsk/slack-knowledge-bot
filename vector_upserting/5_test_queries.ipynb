    "(2) “afterTimestampFilter” This argument is also unix timestamp. If this argument is null, then all threads that happened after start of the Acme Inc.’s slack, which is 1546370412 or 01/01/2019.\n",

You should use the reference to the current date ({CURR_TIME} or {CURR_TIME_FORMATTED} ) to calculate the corrent timeframe. If only name of the month is specified, then “afterTimestampFilter” is first day and “beforeTimestampFilter” is 30th day (except for Feb, where it is 28th)\n",
